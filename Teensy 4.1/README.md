The programming of Teensy 4.1 is similar with the code used in Raspberry Pi Pico with the main differences to be the usage of the Encoder library provided in Teensy which made the angle reading of the motor to be 
calculated without CPU involvement. The other difference is that Teensy 4.1 has an onboard microSD card reader so there was no need for the Breakout board of the microSD card.
